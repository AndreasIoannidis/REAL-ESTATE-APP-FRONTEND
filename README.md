Designed and built a responsive web application to simplify the process of finding and acquiring apartments for rent or sale. The platform allows users to explore, search, and inquire about apartments available for rent or purchase, enhancing the property browsing experience, although it has encountered a few errors that I am actively addressing. Technologies/Tools Used: React.js, Chakra UI, JavaScript, Rapid API, HTML/CSS, Git for version control.
